Python Compression Program
This program allows users to compress files and folders into various compressed file types, such as .zip, .tar, and .tgz. When the user selects .tgz as their compress type, the archive or compressed files or folder will be saved as "name_of_the_folder_date_month_year."

Usage
To use the program, simply run the Python script and follow the prompts. The user will be prompted to select the folder to compress and then display a list of available compressed file types. The user should be able to select the desired compressed file type from the list, and the program will compress the selected folder using the selected compressed file type.

The program will also display a message to the user indicating the success or failure of the compression process. If the compression process fails, the program will provide an error message explaining the cause of the failure.

Dependencies
This program requires the following Python libraries:

tarfile
zipfile
Make sure to install these libraries before running the script.
